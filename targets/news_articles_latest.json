        "description": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas.",
        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "content": "On Thursday morning, over 100 suspected hoodlums attacked a police station in the Ipaja area of Lagos State. Eyewitnesses reported that the attack was likely a response to a police raid on motorcycle riders, known locally as Okada riders, in the area. The confrontation led to an exchange of gunfire, causing panic and forcing passersby to flee for safety. The police, however, successfully repelled the attackers. Benjamin Hundeyin, the police spokesman in Lagos State, confirmed to Channels Television that the assailants were indeed Okada riders retaliating against the enforcement actions taken by the police. He praised the officers and men of the Ipaja division for their strong resistance against the attack. Hundeyin did not provide details on whether there were any casualties during the incident but assured that normalcy had been restored to the area. Additional police detachments have been deployed to maintain order and prevent further disturbances. ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

Some of those killed were displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Many were women and children. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas. Even some of its closest allies like the United States are expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel says it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts. One of those courts last week demanded that Israel halt its offensive in Rafah. EU, Israel in war of words as ties nosedive ahead of Spain, Ireland recognizing Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah while Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leader of Hamas. Latest deadly weather in US kills at least 20 as storms carve path of ruin across multiple states VALLEY VIEW, Texas (AP) — Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms obliterated homes and destroyed a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park. Eight people were killed in Arkansas. Three died in Kentucky, and two were killed in Oklahoma. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. Papua New Guinea says Friday's landslide buried more than 2,000 people and formally asks for help MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive by a landslide Friday. The official formally asked for international help. The government figure is roughly triple a U.N. estimate of 670 killed in the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. In a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center Luseta Laso Mana said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” at Yambali village in the Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. China has threatened trade with some countries after feuds. They're calling 'the firm' for help WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department has set up an eight-person team known as “the firm” to provide help to countries cut off from Chinese trade. The team emerged after Washington stepped in to help Lithuania when the northern European country found its cargo shipments to and from China stranded two years ago during a feud over Taiwan. State Department officials say Washington sees ”the firm” as an emergency response when a country fears facing economic pressure from China. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. says Beijing opposes economic coercion and calls the American allegation “completely unfounded.\" Russian POWs get to make phone calls home. Ukrainians don't. A growing movement wants that to change FAR WESTERN UKRAINE (AP) — For hundreds of Russian soldiers taken prisoner, phone calls home can offer a bit of comfort and hope. It's a lifeline unavailable to Ukrainian POWs, whose families have gone without hearing their voices. Now, Ukrainian families of POWs are demanding an end to the calls to Russia. They're appealing a decision to block a petition that got more than 25,000 signatures. The families’ anger and the petition rejection come amid widespread reports of systematic mistreatment of Ukrainians in Russian captivity. Ukraine has regularly opened its main POW camp to the Red Cross, the U.N. and journalists. The Associated Press recently visited the western Ukraine site. It's a full day’s journey from the front lines. The visit took place on condition its location not be revealed. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance. Military labs do the detective work to identify soldiers decades after they died in World War II OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency experts strive to offer about 200 families annually the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. Advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year.",

        "content": "The Houston Astros expect to have a familiar face back in the clubhouse when they open a four-game series Monday at Seattle. First baseman Jose Abreu is scheduled to rejoin the ballclub after he was optioned to the Astros' spring training complex in West Palm Beach, Fla. He had been working on his swing with, among others, Hall of Fame member Jeff Bagwell and former teammate Michael Brantley. Abreu, the 2020 American League MVP with the Chicago White Sox, was batting .099 with one extra-base hit and three RBIs in 22 games when he was sent to the minors for the first time in his career. \"What I can tell you is my head is in a good spot right now,\" Abreu told The Athletic. \"When I was going through it, when your head is not in a good spot, you feel like everything is going down. There was a point, and I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart, I couldn't even know how to hit, how to field. I was a little lost. But I'm humble enough to recognize that and I'm telling you I'm trying to be the best Jose Abreu I can be and the one you guys know.\" Abreu went 7-for-22 with a homer and three RBIs in the Florida Complex League before playing in two games for the Triple-A Sugar Land Space Cowboys, going 0-for-7 with three strikeouts. \"The plan is to bring him for the Seattle series and just come in with confidence,\" Astros manager Joe Espada said. \"He has made adjustments that we feel are going to help him and we just expect him to come back up here and just be himself and we're going to help him, get him rolling. We're all waiting for him, our players are excited, we are excited to have him back, so we're looking forward to it.\" Abreu, 37, batted .237 with 18 home runs and 90 RBIs last season, his first in Houston after signing a three-year, $58.5 million deal. \"I was wrong on my swing, and games speed up on you too much and it's tough to see where you're at,\" Abreu said through an interpreter. \"I saw videos and didn't see it, and now we found it and I hope that I can show it right away, right now, but it's baseball, it's a process.\" The Astros won 5-2 at Oakland on Sunday as Kyle Tucker belted a two-run homer and Ronel Blanco allowed the Athletics one run on four hits over seven innings. \"He didn't miss a beat,\" Espada said of Blanco, who returned from a 10-game suspension for having an illegal substance on his glove. Houston has won 10 of its past 14 games to pull within 3 1/2 games of the American League West-leading Mariners. On May 1, the Astros were in last place in the division, 6 1/2 games out. Seattle snapped a season-worst, four-game losing streak with a 9-5 victory at Washington on Sunday. Julio Rodriguez went 3-for-5 with a home run and four RBIs and Ty France went deep and drove in three. Rodriguez homered in each of the last two games in the series to double his season total to four. \"Huge game by Julio,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \"Really happy for him. Everybody's happy to see it. That's the Julio Rodriguez we've grown to know over the last couple of years and hopefully he can keep that going. That's the best he's looked all year.\" Astros left-hander Framber Valdez (3-2, 4.32 ERA) is set to start the series opener Monday against Mariners right-hander Bryce Miller (3-5, 3.53). Valdez is 5-2 with a 3.41 ERA in 13 career appearances (11 starts) against Seattle; Miller is 2-1, 3.22 in four career starts versus Houston. Valdez lost 5-0 to the visiting Mariners on May 4 as he allowed five runs on nine hits in 5 1/3 innings. Miller didn't get a decision in Seattle's 5-4 victory at Houston on May 5, a game in which he gave up four runs on six hits over six innings. --Field Level Media",

Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah while Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leader of Hamas. Latest deadly weather in US kills at least 20 as storms carve path of ruin across multiple states VALLEY VIEW, Texas (AP) — Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms obliterated homes and destroyed a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park. Eight people were killed in Arkansas. Three died in Kentucky, and two were killed in Oklahoma. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. Papua New Guinea says Friday's landslide buried more than 2,000 people and formally asks for help MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive by a landslide Friday. The official formally asked for international help. The government figure is roughly triple a U.N. estimate of 670 killed in the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. In a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center Luseta Laso Mana said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” at Yambali village in the Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. China has threatened trade with some countries after feuds. They're calling 'the firm' for help WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department has set up an eight-person team known as “the firm” to provide help to countries cut off from Chinese trade. The team emerged after Washington stepped in to help Lithuania when the northern European country found its cargo shipments to and from China stranded two years ago during a feud over Taiwan. State Department officials say Washington sees ”the firm” as an emergency response when a country fears facing economic pressure from China. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. says Beijing opposes economic coercion and calls the American allegation “completely unfounded.\" Russian POWs get to make phone calls home. Ukrainians don't. A growing movement wants that to change FAR WESTERN UKRAINE (AP) — For hundreds of Russian soldiers taken prisoner, phone calls home can offer a bit of comfort and hope. It's a lifeline unavailable to Ukrainian POWs, whose families have gone without hearing their voices. Now, Ukrainian families of POWs are demanding an end to the calls to Russia. They're appealing a decision to block a petition that got more than 25,000 signatures. The families’ anger and the petition rejection come amid widespread reports of systematic mistreatment of Ukrainians in Russian captivity. Ukraine has regularly opened its main POW camp to the Red Cross, the U.N. and journalists. The Associated Press recently visited the western Ukraine site. It's a full day’s journey from the front lines. The visit took place on condition its location not be revealed. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance. Military labs do the detective work to identify soldiers decades after they died in World War II OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency experts strive to offer about 200 families annually the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. Advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt its offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths, saying it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,\" said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had been housing more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group on Sunday launched a barrage of rockets from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Israel has adamantly denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "The San Diego Padres have hovered around .500 all season, but maybe their newest weapon can help them string together some wins. In Sunday's 5-2 victory over the visiting New York Yankees, flamethrowing right-hander Jeremiah Estrada jumped to prominence, striking out all five batters he faced and setting a Padres franchise record by fanning his past 10. The Padres, who had lost five straight home games, have the surging Miami Marlins coming to town for a three-game set that starts Monday. San Diego manager Mike Shildt professed to knowing Estrada's potential since the right-hander was claimed off waivers from the Chicago Cubs in the offseason. \"This guy's got an elite fastball, and now he's got secondary pitches in the zone. It's just a lethal combination,\" Shildt said after Sunday's game. Estrada routinely hit 97-98 mph and mixed in splitters and sliders. \"He demonstrated a lot of positive things throughout the offseason with us, including spring training, and the message just continued to (be) get better at some of these things, (that) ‘If you do that, you can be a force at the back end of games.'\" Estrada came on in relief of starter Joe Musgrove with one out in the sixth inning after the Yankees took a 1-0 lead. The 25-year-old struck out the red-hot Aaron Judge on three pitches and Alex Verdugo on four. After San Diego rallied for four runs in the bottom of the inning, Estrada took down Giancarlo Stanton, Anthony Rizzo and Gleyber Torres. Since being called up from Triple-A El Paso on April 26, Estrada is 2-0 with a 0.59 ERA and one save in 11 appearances. Right-hander Michael King (4-4, 4.28 ERA) gets the start for the Padres on Monday. In May, King is 2-1 with a 3.24 ERA. He is coming off a 7-3 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday. He went 6 2/3 innings, giving up three runs on four hits and two walks with six strikeouts. King has faced the Marlins once in his career. While with the Yankees, he pitched two innings as an opener and allowed two runs on four hits with three strikeouts in a 3-1 loss in Miami on Aug. 12. While the Marlins have won nine of their past 13 games, including four consecutive series, their starter on Monday has been struggling. Left-hander Trevor Rogers (1-6, 6.11) has been limited to no more than 3 2/3 innings in three of his past four starts, after going at least five innings in his first six. In his past four starts, he is 1-2 with a 10.05 ERA. He has allowed 17 runs (16 earned) on 26 hits with 11 walks, one hit batter and 14 strikeouts. Opponents hit .377 against him in that span. Rogers has made one start against the Padres in his career, tossing five shutout innings in a no-decision in May 2022. Miami took two out of three against the host Arizona Diamondbacks over the weekend, with Marlins pitchers holding the reigning National League champions to four runs in three games. Jake Burger went 6-for-12 in the series after entering the weekend hitting .164 in his first 31 games. He scored three runs and drove in three versus the Diamondbacks. Burger credited the coaching staff for helping him get on track. \"I think maybe (hitting coach John) Mabry and I got some stuff figured out in the cage. ... Just, like, calming everything down in the box,\" Burger told Bally Sports Florida. \"Skip (Schumaker, manager) and I had a really good conversation a couple days ago. He's like, ‘Hey, when you're out there, you have swagger when you're right. Nothing's speeding you up, you're not rushing to get in the box, you're kinda bobbing your head to the music, whatever it may be.' ... You know what? Let's just get back to having fun.\" --Field Level Media",

        "content": "Aidan O'Brien's City Of Troy is one of 20 left in Saturday's Betfred Derby after Tabletalk was supplemented for the Classic at Monday's confirmation stage. The open nature of this year's race seems likely to lead to a big field at Epsom, with last season's champion juvenile City Of Troy set to start as the favourite despite disappointing in the 2000 Guineas. He is one of six left in by Aidan O'Brien, including the unbeaten Los Angeles, a Group One winner at two and successful in Leopardstown's key Derby trial. Diego Velazquez, Euphoric, Illinois and Portland could also represent the Ballydoyle handler, although the first-named colt is the ante-post favourite for Sunday's Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly. Adrian Murray's Dallas Star is another trained in Ireland in the mix after winning the Ballysax Stakes. Tabletalk, a Chelmsford winner last time out for Tom Clover, was supplemented at a cost of £75,000. Ambiente Friendly, the subject of plenty of talk in the last week due to connections switching jockeys from Callum Shepherd to Robert Havlin, holds strong claims based on his win at Lingfield, while Roger Teal's Dancing Gemini, second in the French Guineas, is another with top-class form. Mqse De Sevigne strikes late in Prix d'Ispahan nail-biter 'They work well together' | Joorabchian sheds light on Freire and Ffrench-Davis linkup Charlie Appleby and Godolphin rely on Ancient Wisdom, having once looked like having three strong contenders, and Ralph Beckett is due to run Macduff. Watch every race from Royal Ascot, all live on Sky Sports Racing from Tuesday 18th June to Saturday 22nd June Deira Mile, God's Window, Kamboo, Mr Hampstead, Padesha, Sayedaty Sadaty and Voyage have also been left in. Connections of Blue Riband Trial winner Bellum Justum believe this is the year to take a chance. With the Guineas winner Notable Speech sticking to a mile, the placed horses from Newmarket running in the Irish equivalent and the impressive Dante winner Economics skipping Epsom, the Andrew Balding-trained colt is a live outsider. \"All is good, we're happy with him and it looks a very open year. It's quite hard to assess the form lines this year,\" said Alistair Donald of owners King Power Racing. \"At least we know he can go around the track and I think we'll stay the trip. I've said before I don't know if he's quite good enough to win it, but I do think he'll run a good race. \"This is the year to take a chance with a horse like him, as there are question marks over so many of the runners, it's a very interesting Derby.\" The only two horses not confirmed were Roger Varian's Defiance and O'Brien's The Euphrates.

        "description": "Hundreds of shareable electric scooters have vanished across the Bay Area in recent years — a pivot from industry promises to revolutionize micromobility in an eco-friendly, affordable way.",
        "content": "BERKELEY — E-scooters aren’t hard to find, whether they’re zipping down city streets, cluttering public sidewalks or sitting, half-submerged, in a neighborhood pond. But hundreds of the shareable electric scooters have vanished across the Bay Area in recent years — a pivot from industry promises to revolutionize micromobility in an eco-friendly, affordable way. While some brands such as Lime and Bird are still powering forward, a growing number of e-scooter companies have quietly shuttered, declared bankruptcy and even abandoned communities outright, often without any explanation. Rent-a-scooter companies frequently blame this downward trend on financial woes — stemming from both over-investment of private equity and lackluster revenue streams. As e-scooter enterprises continue to take their business and equipment offline, some commuters, tourists and residents have been left to their own devices trying to cope with gaps in service that buses, trains and other traditional modes of public transportation struggle to fill. But it’s unclear whether local governments are politically motivated — or physically equipped — to help address the complicated safety and access concerns that are exacerbating the micromobility industry’s economic struggles. In May 2022, the e-scooter company Superpedestrian of 200 stand-up scooters and 50 seated scooters in Berkeley. Nineteen months later, they were gone. Superpedestrian announced that its scooters by the last day of 2023, despite just 18 months earlier. Joining a host of shared e-scooter brands that folded in major metropolitan areas worldwide, their neon chartreuse “LINK” e-scooters are no longer visible on the company’s app-based maps of Berkeley and Oakland — two of the cities where machines were yanked before being put . Meanwhile, VeoRide is the only remaining option to — at least through the end of June. Spokesperson Matthai Chakko said the city is currently working through the “permittee selection process” for the next fiscal year, which will determine the number of operators and e-scooters that will be available for use. He said that out of the 224,048 total e-scooter trips across Berkeley last year, roughly 22% were taken on Superpedestrian e-scooters. Looking ahead, Chakko said that “the city is open to expanding the available fleet, however, expansion is dependent on operator performance and user demand, among other things.” The current outlook for e-scooters — which generally cost under a dollar per minute to ride, along with an unlock fee — is a lot less rosy than when the industry first got rolling in California just seven years ago. Bird e-scooters were the first ones to appear by September 2017, when the company scattered hundreds of them on the streets of Santa Monica within just a few days. Bird was valued at $1 billion within its first year in business and $2.5 billion by 2019. However, Bird was temporarily grounded after it last winter — only three months after , Spin, for $19 million. By April 5, the company it had successfully sold its assets and emerged as part of Third Lane Mobility Inc. — now the largest micromobility operator in North America, encompassing both the Bird and Spin brands, which recently won multiple new competitive bids and started service in several new cities, according to the April news release. The list of shuttered or acquired companies has grown since their 2017 introduction. For example, while Spin, Scoot, Lime and Jump were awarded to operate in San Francisco in 2019, only Spin and Lime were still in business in the city by . Despite headlines about bankruptcy, acquisitions and an overall lack of cash for some rent-a-scooter operators, the fate of the industry hasn’t dimmed entirely. According to an from the National Association of City Transportation Officials on the state of shared micromobility in 2022, there were 56.5 million trips nationwide on “dockless” e-scooters, which can be parked anywhere. Compared to 65 million trips in 2021, the report attributes the recent dip to the industry’s recent financial struggles and business shifts. However, the total number of trips has hit 730 million since 2010. While the South Bay has a slightly smaller list of options, e-scooters operated by Lime, Spin and Bird can be found in cities like San Jose, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Redwood City and Millbrae. Wheels powered by Veo, however, are concentrated in the East Bay and Southern California. Looking ahead, national association said communities must tackle redesigning streets, such as adding wider bike lanes that can better accommodate more people traveling at different speeds in order to help support e-scooters and other micromobility systems. “One billion trips on shared bikes and scooters is just around the corner,” the report said, “and cities that form strong partnerships with both their operators and the communities they serve will be the ones that lead the way.” Sandwiched between Berkeley and Oakland, Emeryville has not only maintained a range of options for , but the city’s elected officials have made a concerted push for finding safer places for riders. Former Emeryville Mayor John Bauters said the success of any form of micromobility transportation relies on a local government’s ability — and desire — to invest in infrastructure specifically designed to accommodate those options, such as protected bike lanes and the car-free Emeryville Greenway. He said one of the biggest problems started when American roadways were redesigned to primarily accommodate automobiles. Despite the benefits of reducing emissions and the costs associated with car ownership, Bauters said people may shy away from accessing e-scooters and other alternative forms of transportation because they lack safe places to ride — on roadways and sidewalks, alike. “Scooter companies — predictably, in my opinion — are not succeeding because cities aren’t responding to the public desire to have choices by giving people safe infrastructure that matches those choices,” Bauters said. “The people who are choosing to use them — whether it’s because they’re more cost-effective, faster or more fun — they’re being pushed out of using it because the sidewalk isn’t for them, and neither is the street. We haven’t given them a space. Companies fail because there’s only so long in which a person who’s trying to use something that is innovative and more accessible decides it’s not worth it.”",

        "description": "Nacada CEO Anthony Omerikwa says establishments less than 300 from schools targeted.",
        "content": "The National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug and Drug Abuse has announced a nationwide crackdown to close down bars and other liquor dispensing outlets located near learning institutions. In a statement on Monday, chief executive officer Anthony Omerikwa said the crackdown will affect bars and liquor dispensing establishments located less than 300 meters from educational institutions or areas catering to individuals below 18 years. “The crackdown will be executed in collaboration with relevant national and county government agencies and seeks to ensure strict compliance with legal requirements about the positioning of such outlets,” he said. Omerikwa said the initiative is anchored in the Alcoholic Drinks Control Act of 2010. “Moreover, it serves as a reminder to all players in the community in their role in enhancing the safe development and wellbeing of our children,” the Nacada CEO said. The Alcoholic Drinks Control Act provides a legal liability to any person who sells alcoholic drinks in prohibited locations. This is like a fine not exceeding Sh500,000 or imprisonment to a jail term not exceeding three years, or both. The crackdown is the latest in a series of other government initiatives aimed at arresting alcohol and drug abuse, especially among the youth. On May 20, Nacada ordered the removal of billboards promoting alcoholic drinks near learning institutions. The Authority said the advertisements were likely to create an erroneous impression about the characteristics, health effects, health hazards, or social effects of the alcoholic drink. It said the exposure of youth to outdoor alcohol advertising near schools was likely to mislead youth to use alcohol. The move adds to another initiative spearheaded by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua to contain illicit brew use and drug abuse among the youth. The initiative has so far achieved commendable milestones with the Interior Ministry reporting that 18,650 unlicensed liquor joints had been closed as of March 25, 2024. While issuing the update, the CS said 12,150 premises which were operating across 47 counties without licenses and 6,500 others which were licensed contrary to National Law on proximity to learning institutions had also been shut. The CS said 14 distilleries that were manufacturing toxic killer brew had also been closed and their production infrastructure destroyed. Gachagua has on countless occasions reaffirmed the government’s commitment to rid the country of illicit brew saying it will not relent on the nationwide fight against manufacturers of the killer brew. \"President, CS Kindiki and I have resolved that we can't allow the lives of our youths to be destroyed by illicit brew. We have deployed stringent measures to save the generation. Those selling legit alcoholic drinks will not be affected,\" Gachagua said in Meru on March 23.",

Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. ‘Furiosa,’ ‘Garfield’ lead slowest Memorial Day box office in decades The Memorial Day box office is cruising for a two-decade low. “Furiosa,” the Mad Max prequel starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, claimed the first place spot for Friday-Saturday-Sunday with $25.6 million. That is according to studio estimates on Sunday. Warner Bros. is waiting until Monday to release its four-day estimates. That left room for the weekend's other new opener, “The Garfield Movie,” to claim No. 1 for the four-day holiday weekend with $31.9 million. Aside from Memorial Day in 2020 when theaters were closed due to COVID-19, these are the lowest-earning No. 1 movies on this weekend in 29 years. Paris' traffic-clogged Champs-Elysees turned into a mass picnic blanket for an unusual meal PARIS (AP) — The French capital’s most famous street has been transformed into a massive picnic blanket. Around 4,000 people sat in the sun on Sunday enjoying an al fresco meal on the Champs-Elysees Avenue. The lucky picnickers were selected in a draw and provided with free baskets with delicacies from some of the top chefs in Paris. A tablecloth ran around 216 yards from the Arc de Triomphe along the avenue and served as the sitting area for the event. The event comes exactly two months before Paris hosts the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics. Nicki Minaj's England concert postponed after rapper was detained by Dutch authorities over pot MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Nicki Minaj’s concert in Manchester, England, scheduled for Saturday night was postponed after police in the Netherlands discovered marijuana in her bags as she was preparing to leave the country. Promoter Live Nation said the show would be rescheduled soon and tickets were honored. It said Minaj made “best efforts” to make the show in time. Minaj tweeted earlier Saturday that police at the Amsterdam airport stopped her Saturday as she was about to board a plane for a concert in Manchester, England. She tweeted that police told her they found marijuana in her bags, and it would have to be weighed. Cannabis is illegal in the Netherlands, but it is tolerated for recreational use.

        "content": "Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital.

Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. ‘Furiosa,’ ‘Garfield’ lead slowest Memorial Day box office in decades The Memorial Day box office is cruising for a two-decade low. “Furiosa,” the Mad Max prequel starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, claimed the first place spot for Friday-Saturday-Sunday with $25.6 million. That is according to studio estimates on Sunday. Warner Bros. is waiting until Monday to release its four-day estimates. That left room for the weekend's other new opener, “The Garfield Movie,” to claim No. 1 for the four-day holiday weekend with $31.9 million. Aside from Memorial Day in 2020 when theaters were closed due to COVID-19, these are the lowest-earning No. 1 movies on this weekend in 29 years. Paris' traffic-clogged Champs-Elysees turned into a mass picnic blanket for an unusual meal PARIS (AP) — The French capital’s most famous street has been transformed into a massive picnic blanket. Around 4,000 people sat in the sun on Sunday enjoying an al fresco meal on the Champs-Elysees Avenue. The lucky picnickers were selected in a draw and provided with free baskets with delicacies from some of the top chefs in Paris. A tablecloth ran around 216 yards from the Arc de Triomphe along the avenue and served as the sitting area for the event. The event comes exactly two months before Paris hosts the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics. Nicki Minaj's England concert postponed after rapper was detained by Dutch authorities over pot MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Nicki Minaj’s concert in Manchester, England, scheduled for Saturday night was postponed after police in the Netherlands discovered marijuana in her bags as she was preparing to leave the country. Promoter Live Nation said the show would be rescheduled soon and tickets were honored. It said Minaj made “best efforts” to make the show in time. Minaj tweeted earlier Saturday that police at the Amsterdam airport stopped her Saturday as she was about to board a plane for a concert in Manchester, England. She tweeted that police told her they found marijuana in her bags, and it would have to be weighed. Cannabis is illegal in the Netherlands, but it is tolerated for recreational use. Chiefs' Butker has no regrets about expressing his beliefs during recent commencement speech Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker has no regrets about expressing his beliefs in a recent commencement speech and he said he has received support as well as “a shocking level of hate” from others.

The 75-year-old penned a heartwarming message to the peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Highlands following the landslide in Enga on Friday 24 May 2024. \"My wife and I were deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the devastating landslide in Enga, and the tragic loss of so many lives, homes and food gardens. \"I have witnessed at first-hand and have great admiration for, the extraordinary resilience of the peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Highlands. I have faith that your communities will come together to support the survivors and the recovery in these heartbreaking circumstances. \"My wife joins me in sending our most heartfelt condolences to the families and communities who have suffered so much as a result of this appallingly traumatic event. Papua New Guinea is very much in our special thoughts and prayers.\" As many as 2,000 people are feared buried under Papua New Guinea landslide as survivors dig with hands and spades. Locals have been left reeling after tonnes of rock and mud smashed into their homes as they slept, and rescuers have struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia’s poorest nations leaving locals with little choice but to dig through the collapsed mountainside with whatever tools they have. Papua New Guinea is home to around 10 million people. Its vast mountainous terrain and lack of roads have made it difficult to access the affected area. Papua is one of five countries in Asia and the Pacific where the His Majesty is head of state. They also include Australia, New Zealand, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. At a ceremony also honouring the late Queen, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape said: “In reflection of the life she lived, the exemplary performance of duties as the head of the state of Papua New Guinea, it is in this connection that we all gather here this morning to acknowledge her passing and to acknowledge and witness the ascension of the throne of King Charles III,” the Associated Press reported.

Deputy Governor Adnan Zaylani Mohamad Zahid said the foreign exchange policy flexibilities, as a package, are expected to reduce the concern of foreign exchange mismatch for both the lender and the borrower. \"Another shared priority is our respective focus on green finance and sustainability agenda. \"We would also like to welcome greater engagement from multilateral development banks such as the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) to participate in providing financing and critical expertise in the area of sustainable development in Malaysia, particularly in green finance and sustainability,\" he said during a keynote address at the roundtable discussion between the IsDB and Malaysia’s Islamic Financial Markets Subcommittee (IFMC) today.

        "content": "The importance of self-defence for everyone as a lifelong skill In today’s unpredictable world, the importance of self-defence cannot be overstated. Whether young or old, male or female, everyone can benefit from learning how to protect themselves. Self-defence encompasses a range of techniques and strategies designed to help individuals defend against physical threats. However, its benefits extend beyond physical protection, enhancing mental well-being and fostering a sense of empowerment. BUILDING CONFIDENCE AND EMPOWERMENT One of the most significant benefits of learning self-defence is the boost in confidence it provides. Knowing you have the skills to protect yourself in a potentially dangerous situation instils a sense of security and empowerment. This confidence transcends physical scenarios and seeps into everyday life, making individuals more assertive and less likely to be intimidated or bullied. For women and girls, in particular, self-defence training can be transformative. Societal norms and gender-based violence often leave women feeling vulnerable. By equipping themselves with self-defence skills, women can challenge these norms and take control of their safety. This empowerment is crucial in fostering gender equality and enabling women to navigate the world with confidence and assurance. ENHANCING PHYSICAL FITNESS AND HEALTH Self-defence training is not just about learning to fight; it’s also an excellent way to improve physical fitness. Many self-defence classes incorporate elements of cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and flexibility. These physical activities contribute to overall health, helping to maintain a healthy weight, improve cardiovascular health, and build muscle strength. Regular physical activity is known to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Moreover, the physical conditioning involved in self-defence training improves coordination, agility, and reflexes, making individuals more adept at handling various physical tasks and challenges. MENTAL RESILIENCE AND STRESS RELIEF The mental benefits of self-defence are equally compelling. Engaging in self-defence training can significantly reduce stress levels. The physical exertion involved helps to release endorphins, the body’s natural mood elevators, which can alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, self-defence training requires mental focus and discipline. Learning to assess situations, make quick decisions, and remain calm under pressure enhances mental resilience. This mental fortitude is invaluable in everyday life, aiding in problem-solving and improving emotional regulation. PROMOTING AWARENESS AND PREVENTION An essential aspect of self-defence is situational awareness. Self-defence training teaches individuals to be mindful of their surroundings and recognise potential threats before they escalate. This heightened awareness is a crucial preventive measure, enabling individuals to avoid dangerous situations altogether. In addition to physical techniques, self-defence training often includes verbal strategies to de-escalate conflicts. Learning how to communicate effectively and assert boundaries can prevent physical confrontations, making self-defence a holistic approach to personal safety. INCLUSIVITY AND LIFELONG LEARNING Self-defence is a valuable skill for people of all ages and abilities. For children, learning self-defence can teach discipline, respect, and the importance of personal boundaries. It can also provide a safe outlet for physical energy and help prevent bullying. For older adults, self-defence training can enhance mobility, balance, and independence. As individuals age, the risk of falls and physical vulnerabilities increase. Self-defence techniques can improve stability and provide seniors with the confidence to live independently. Inclusivity in self-defence training is paramount. Classes tailored to different age groups, fitness levels, and physical capabilities ensure that everyone can benefit from these skills. Adaptive self-defence techniques can accommodate individuals with disabilities, ensuring that personal safety is accessible to all. In a world where safety concerns are ever-present, the importance of self-defence surpasses gender and age. It equips individuals with the tools to protect themselves physically, enhances mental and physical health, and fosters a sense of empowerment and confidence. By promoting awareness, prevention, and inclusivity, self-defence training serves as a vital life skill that benefits everyone, regardless of their stage in life. Investing in self-defence is an investment in personal security and overall well-being, making it a practice that everyone should consider embracing. – IZAH AZAHARI",

        "content": "Nigeria’s U-17 team, the Golden Eaglets , face an uncertain future regarding the 2025 U-17 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) . While their 1-0 semi-final defeat to Ivory Coast in the WAFU B qualifiers ended their hopes of automatic qualification, a potential expansion of the tournament offers a lifeline. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has yet to determine the number of teams qualifying from each zone. Traditionally, only two teams progressed from each region, but speculation suggests this could increase due to FIFA’s expansion of the U-17 World Cup to 32 teams. Golden Eaglets media officer, Francis Achi, remains optimistic. He hints at the possibility of three teams qualifying from WAFU Zone B, with CAF expected to confirm the details soon. ALSO READ : Plateau-calls-for-private-sector-collaboration-to-end-open-defecation/ Meanwhile, Coach Manu Garba remains focused, rallying his team for the third-place match against Ghana. Former U-17 World Cup winner, Festus Odini, however, criticizes the team’s preparation. He believes a lack of training time and proper age-grading procedures contributed to their setback. With CAF set to announce decisions on U-17 AFCON slots, the WAFCON schedule, and the 2025 AFCON , the Golden Eaglets await their fate and a potential shot at redemption.",

        "content": "Two sides who are currently fighting for a place in the top nine of the Western Conference come together on Thursday when Houston Dynamo host Colorado Rapids at the BBVA Compass Stadium in the MLS . The hosts are in eighth place with a game in hand on those below them, while the visitors are sixth and hold a six-point lead over 10th place. © Reuters Since making a return to the Western Conference in 2015 Houston have struggled to finish in the playoff positions come the end of the regular season, competing in the playoffs just twice thanks to a fifth-placed finish in 2017 and fourth place last year. Their fourth-placed finish saw a major improvement compared to recent campaigns as they had finished in the bottom three of the Conference in each of the last four years. Not only did Houston make it into the playoffs for the first time in six seasons but they went all the way through to the Western Conference final, missing out on a place in the MLS Cup final after a 2-0 loss to eventual runners-up Los Angeles FC. Ben Olsen 's men would have been hoping to build upon that this term but an inconsistent start has seen them win five and lose six of their opening 14 fixtures, just five less losses than across the entirety of the 34 league matches last year. While it looked as if Houston had recovered from a draw and a loss in their first two with four wins in the following five outings, the Dynamo have won just one of the seven games since. Their home form will be particularly worrying for Olsen with his side already equalling the number of losses they sustained at the BBVA Compass Stadium last year, and their six goals in seven matches is the second lowest of any side across all 29 teams in the MLS. © Reuters In stark contrast, their upcoming opponents Colorado have been much improved compared to the last campaign, going from the bottom of the Western Conference to sixth after 14 fixtures and already managing more wins than they did in 2023. The Rapids kicked off the 2024 MLS season with a disappointing 4-1 loss to Portland Timbers but rebounded in impressive fashion with just one loss in the following eight. Their form has seen a slight drop in recent weeks with three losses in their last six, including two games without victory heading into this one, and they will be looking to return to winning ways with a win over a Houston side who have just one win in the last eight across all competitions. Colorado have failed to take three points from this fixture in any of the last five meetings, last being the triumphant side in October 2021 with a 1-0 away win. © Reuters The hosts are set to be without no fewer than four players as they look to recover from their recent struggles in the coming game against Colorado. Nelson Quinones and Carlos Ferreira are set to be on the treatment table until early next month, leaving them ruled out of this one. Steve Clark and McKinze Gaines were both forced off in the 1-1 draw with rivals FC Dallas and neither are expected to make a return here. Sebastian Kowalczyk is expected to return to the starting lineup after the striker missed out last time due to an accumulation of yellow cards. Chris Armas will be unable to call upon the services of three of his own for this game, with Daniel Chacon , Kimani Stewart and Wayne Frederick all out until next month. Houston Dynamo possible starting lineup: Tarbell; Dorsey, Sviatchenko, Micael, Steres; Artur, Herrera; Carrasquilla, Bassi, Blessing; Kowalczyk Colorado Rapids possible starting lineup: Steffen; Rosenberry, Bombito, Maxso, Vines; Bassett, Larraz; Cabral, Mihailovic, Fernandez; Navarro Houston have had a disappointing run of fixtures coming into this game and will be far from pleased with their performances at home so far this campaign, and while the Rapids have had a much better start this year they have failed to win at this stadium in either of the last two meetings, and we expect that to continue with a draw here.

        "description": "Misri Khan was lynched while he was on his way to another village to drop off a few buffaloes at his sister's place.",
        "content": "(Trigger Warning: This story contains some details of graphic violence). In the wee hours of 23 May around 5:30 am, Misri Khan Baloch had left his house along with driver Hussain Khan in Mahindra Bolero with a few buffaloes for chappi village, Banaskantha district in Gujarat. However, 'cow vigilantes' damaged the tyres of his vehicle and allegedly beat Misri to death on the road. They killed him because of his identity. They hit him with sticks and iron rods on his heads, so much so that we could see parts of his skull, the insides were visible. His head was bleeding and there were bruises on his shoulder, back and waist. Sher Khan, Misri's elder brother to The Quint Misri, a 40-year-old labourer and part-time farmer, belonged to Sesan Nava village and was on is way to deliver the buffaloes and his sister, Fatimaben for taking care of them before they are sent to factories. However, 7-8 suspected cow vigilantes first punctured their vehicle by throwing iron nails on the ground and attempted to extort money from Misri. Then 50-60 men gathered and crowded them. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD The driver Hussain, who was caught at first, managed to flee. But he went to inform the family and hence, was saved from the mob. \"These men have been forcing all the poor labourers who transport cattle to collectively give them Rs 2 lakh per month. We barely earn enough to support our families, how can we give them money?\" questioned Sher Khan. Bache Khan, the eldest of the three brothers with Misri's body. (Photo: Accessed by The Quint) \"The police was there by the time we reached, although the Agthala police station is just 100 meters away,\" said Sher Khan. The Quint has also accessed the FIR which states that main accused - Akheraj Singh, Vatam, Nikul, Mojru, Pravin Singh - live near their village. The FIR charges include IPC sections 302 (punishment for murder) 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 147 (punishment for rioting) 148, (being armed with a deadly weapon) 143 (unlawful assembly), 506 (2) (criminal intimidation), 120 (concealing design to commit offence) and section 135 of the Gujarat Police Act. 'The Accused Have Grown Up In Front Of Me' The FIR reads that, \"Akheraj threatened them and said, 'we will kill you but not let you leave,'\" further explaining Misri's condition looked like \"he died from the severe blow he received from the iron stick and sharp sticks on his head and other parts of his body.\" However, speaking to The Quint, PH Jadeja, Sub-Inspector at Agthala police station has refused to call it a 'mob-lynching,' per say: We have arrested 13 people till now, including the main accused, Akheraj. But let me clarify that this is not mob lynching as the complainant has mentioned that it was Akheraj who had beaten him in his head. It doesn't come under the definition of mob lynching. PH Jadeja, PSI, Agthala There was also old enmity among these groups, the police official said. On the other hand, Sher Khan said that the accused men live close to their house in the village. \"These men have grown up in front of me, Akheraj's farm is right next to ours. We have known and their families since they were children. Over the past year or so, they got into cow vigilantism and became radicalised and hateful. And today, that hatred and greed to earn killed our loved one,\" remarked a distraught Sher Khan. Misri's body was left in the vehicle after he was killed. (Photo: Accessed by The Quint) Sher Khan also alleged that earlier too, Akheraj had beaten up someone in a village and forced him to shout 'Jai Sri Ram.' He was also booked under PASA (Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act). He also feels that the police does \"nothing do anything to stop it\" and the accused have been seen \"roaming around with the police.\" Children Say 'Papa Has Gone to Work' His brother, paused during our phone conversation and then said, \"If you look at Misri now, your heart will ache. The way his body was, in blood, if you could look at it, you wouldn't believe it.\" The family buried Misri at 5 pm on the same day he was killed. He is now survived by his wife, Jivibai, two sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, Jivibai reeling from the shock, choked up while talking about Misri. I told the kids, 'He's gone to earn, he'll come back.' They're saying, 'Papa gaye mazdoori karne.' But they have seen that I haven't stopped crying. Jivibai, Misri Khan's wife Misri, along with his wife and children. (Photo: Accessed by The Quint) Jivibai, a labourer herself, said she was calling Misri but to no avail and found out later that he had died. \"I feel like like he was just here some hours ago.\" Jivibai, crying added, \"Both of us had lost our parents so he was my support and I was his. He was the kind of person who used to be happy always and made us laugh too. He was the light of my life.\" Misri's photo posted by one of their family members. (Photo: Accessed by The Quint) Meanwhile, Sher Khan, remembering his brother, noted, \"All Hindus and Muslims in our village knew him and his truck, many times he gave our villagers a ride as well. He helped them as much as they could, irrespective of their religion.\" ( At The Quint, we are answerable only to our audience. Play an active role in shaping our journalism by becoming a membe r .

        "description": "The pauses come in the wake of the Ninth Court declining in January to rehear Berkeley’s ban on natural gas in new buildings, which was first struck down by the court in April 2023.",
        "content": "Bay Area cities and counties are holding off on enforcing natural gas bans in new buildings following a recent federal ruling, a controversial move environmental groups worry will delay achieving key climate goals. The Sunnyvale City Council recently temporarily suspended its ban on natural gas in new buildings, which was first adopted in 2022 to help cut Sunnyvale’s greenhouse emissions in half by the end of the decade. Recently, Cupertino announced the city will suspend its gas ban until this fall. In the East Bay, the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors earlier this month agreed to pause their all-electric building requirement and gas ban in unincorporated areas of the county. San Mateo County and San Luis Obispo also recently suspended their bans. The pauses come in the wake of the Ninth Court declining in January to rehear Berkeley’s ban on natural gas in new buildings, which was first struck down by the court in April 2023. A panel of judges ruled that Berkeley cannot prohibit natural gas due to a pre-existing federal energy law. Berkeley has since agreed to repeal the ban. The Ninth Court’s ruling doesn’t affect cities that have taken a building code-based approach to adopting natural gas bans — like Sunnyvale, Palo Alto and Mountain View — but those cities are also choosing to suspend bans to avoid possible litigation or other legal issues in the future. In 2019, the California Restaurant Association (CRA) sued Berkeley for implementing the gas ban claiming it was “passed with a disregard for available cooking technologies and ultimately for small businesses in the community that rely on gas-burning equipment for their cuisines.” But environmentalists say all-electric buildings — which have no natural gas or propane plumbing installed and use electricity as the sole source of energy for heating, cooking and other home appliances — are more affordable, energy-efficient and crucial for accomplishing California’s goal of achieving 100% zero-carbon energy by 2045. “Building electrification is a huge opportunity,” said Pamela Leonard, deputy director of marketing and communications for Silicon Valley Clean Energy. “There’s a climate benefit, of no longer polluting as you’re putting in new buildings that are going to last 50 to 100 years, but there is also a cost aspect — it costs more to build with gas.” Dashiell Leeds, conservation coordinator at the Sierra Club Loma Prieta Chapter, said using gas appliances contributes to poor air quality and exposes people to pollutants like nitrogen oxide. “Every new gas pipeline installed is a public health liability and step backward on climate change,” he said. “The more we can avoid the hazards of gas pipelines and gas appliances in new buildings, the better off we all are.” In the wake of the court decision, organizations like Silicon Valley Clean Energy, a Sunnyvale-based not-for-profit agency that provides clean electricity for 96% of residents and businesses across Santa Clara County, are looking for ways to encourage people to be eco-friendly. Zoe Elizabeth, deputy director of Decarbonization Programs and Policy at Silicon Valley Clean Energy, said more homeowners and housing markets are becoming aware of the benefits of electric buildings, and are choosing to use them without direction from local governments. Sunnyvale city spokesperson Jennifer Garnett said the city has other measures besides its suspended gas ban to encourage electric infrastructure, including allowing residential and commercial projects with all-electric designs to increase their floor area ratio. City staff will present the council with other ways to deter local builders from installing gas piping after six months. “We do not anticipate that this short pause will negatively affect our ability to meet our climate action targets,” Garnett said in a statement. “We’ll also continue to encourage all-electric adoption.” While cities and advocacy groups try to promote electric usage, some local business owners say they like gas better but are prepared to be flexible. “I enjoy cooking with gas more,” said Heirloom Chef co-owner and personal chef Erika Minkowsky. “I think there is more control with the temperature.” Heirloom is a personal chef service that caters mainly to the East Bay and San Fransisco region. The local chef team often uses their client’s gas and electric appliances to create meals. Still, Minkowsky said electrical appliances are better for the environment and supports using them, even if they take a while to get used to. Related Articles “You can get used to anything if you practice enough,” she said. Claudio Bono, managing director for the Cupertino Hotel, also supports the idea of no-gas buildings but is concerned about the practicality of going all-electric. The building uses electricity to run appliances like laundry machines and gas for cooking in the kitchen. “If the switch was easy, we would love to have that,” Bono said. “But in a hybrid way, so if one thing falls we have another (power source) to sustain us operationally.”",

        "description": "The pauses come in the wake of the Ninth Court declining in January to rehear Berkeley’s ban on natural gas in new buildings, which was first struck down by the court in April 2023.",
        "content": "Bay Area cities and counties are holding off on enforcing natural gas bans in new buildings following a recent federal ruling, a controversial move environmental groups worry will delay achieving key climate goals. The Sunnyvale City Council recently temporarily suspended its ban on natural gas in new buildings, which was first adopted in 2022 to help cut Sunnyvale’s greenhouse emissions in half by the end of the decade. Recently, Cupertino announced the city will suspend its gas ban until this fall. In the East Bay, the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors earlier this month agreed to pause their all-electric building requirement and gas ban in unincorporated areas of the county. San Mateo County and San Luis Obispo also recently suspended their bans. The pauses come in the wake of the Ninth Court declining in January to rehear Berkeley’s ban on natural gas in new buildings, which was first struck down by the court in April 2023. A panel of judges ruled that Berkeley cannot prohibit natural gas due to a pre-existing federal energy law. Berkeley has since agreed to repeal the ban. The Ninth Court’s ruling doesn’t affect cities that have taken a building code-based approach to adopting natural gas bans — like Sunnyvale, Palo Alto and Mountain View — but those cities are also choosing to suspend bans to avoid possible litigation or other legal issues in the future. In 2019, the California Restaurant Association (CRA) sued Berkeley for implementing the gas ban claiming it was “passed with a disregard for available cooking technologies and ultimately for small businesses in the community that rely on gas-burning equipment for their cuisines.” But environmentalists say all-electric buildings — which have no natural gas or propane plumbing installed and use electricity as the sole source of energy for heating, cooking and other home appliances — are more affordable, energy-efficient and crucial for accomplishing California’s goal of achieving 100% zero-carbon energy by 2045. “Building electrification is a huge opportunity,” said Pamela Leonard, deputy director of marketing and communications for Silicon Valley Clean Energy. “There’s a climate benefit, of no longer polluting as you’re putting in new buildings that are going to last 50 to 100 years, but there is also a cost aspect — it costs more to build with gas.” Dashiell Leeds, conservation coordinator at the Sierra Club Loma Prieta Chapter, said using gas appliances contributes to poor air quality and exposes people to pollutants like nitrogen oxide. “Every new gas pipeline installed is a public health liability and step backward on climate change,” he said. “The more we can avoid the hazards of gas pipelines and gas appliances in new buildings, the better off we all are.” In the wake of the court decision, organizations like Silicon Valley Clean Energy, a Sunnyvale-based not-for-profit agency that provides clean electricity for 96% of residents and businesses across Santa Clara County, are looking for ways to encourage people to be eco-friendly. Zoe Elizabeth, deputy director of Decarbonization Programs and Policy at Silicon Valley Clean Energy, said more homeowners and housing markets are becoming aware of the benefits of electric buildings, and are choosing to use them without direction from local governments. Sunnyvale city spokesperson Jennifer Garnett said the city has other measures besides its suspended gas ban to encourage electric infrastructure, including allowing residential and commercial projects with all-electric designs to increase their floor area ratio. City staff will present the council with other ways to deter local builders from installing gas piping after six months. “We do not anticipate that this short pause will negatively affect our ability to meet our climate action targets,” Garnett said in a statement. “We’ll also continue to encourage all-electric adoption.” While cities and advocacy groups try to promote electric usage, some local business owners say they like gas better but are prepared to be flexible. “I enjoy cooking with gas more,” said Heirloom Chef co-owner and personal chef Erika Minkowsky. “I think there is more control with the temperature.” Heirloom is a personal chef service that caters mainly to the East Bay and San Fransisco region. The local chef team often uses their client’s gas and electric appliances to create meals. Still, Minkowsky said electrical appliances are better for the environment and supports using them, even if they take a while to get used to. “You can get used to anything if you practice enough,” she said. Claudio Bono, managing director for the Cupertino Hotel, also supports the idea of no-gas buildings but is concerned about the practicality of going all-electric. The building uses electricity to run appliances like laundry machines and gas for cooking in the kitchen. “If the switch was easy, we would love to have that,” Bono said. “But in a hybrid way, so if one thing falls we have another (power source) to sustain us operationally.”",

        "content": "A PHOTOGRAPHER was rushed to hospital after being hit by flying debris following the horror crash at the Monaco Grand Prix. During Sunday's Formula One race in Monte Carlo , three cars were involved in a shocking first-lap pile up. Look how everyone near the fence gets hit by debris from the crash between Checo and Magnussen. That was super dangerous and I’m just glad no one got hurt. IG: alexandraborchio #MonacoGP pic.twitter.com/WcrurBmdvI Red Bull driver Sergio Perez was tagged by Haas driver Kevin Magnussen on the inside of the track when heading up the Beau Rivage on the way to turn two. The shocking 160mph crash saw Perez's rear right wheel clipped by Magnussen before he violently spun to the right and into the wall before the momentum took him further up the track. Fellow Haas driver Nico Hulkenberg was then caught up in the madness as Perez's car caught him and sent him spinning around. The track was left covered in debris in the aftermath, while Perez's car was left without any of it's wheels and only the monocoque left intact. It's magnitude was so potent that debris spilled over the top of the safety barriers, leading to a lengthy delay as the barriers were repaired. The drivers miraculously escaped with no injuries, but one F1 photographer was caught by debris. F1 safety has come a long way in it's 74 year history. Indeed, a massive tell of this is the safety features of the cars in the modern era. One feature of this is the way the cars break apart in a high-speed crash much like crumple zones seen in road cars. F1 cars now break apart during severe collisions as a means of dissipating the kinetic energy away from the driver taken during the incident. The cars themselves are built around a monocoque - also known as a \"survival cell\" - with 2018 seeing the introduction of the halo prominently on top around the drivers head to boost this further. This safety cell is made from 6millimetre of exceedingly strong carbon fibre composite with a layer of kevlar, which is penetration resistant and can absorb a huge amount of energy in a crash. Meanwhile, the halo was a large reason as to why Romain Grosjean survived his horror crash at the Bahrain Grand Prix in 2020. A picture after the crash showed one person in a hunch on the floor by the track with debris littered around them. One Italian photographer was taken to hospital over fears of a possible injury. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Fortunately, they were later released with the FIA confirming the photographer had not suffered any \"open wounds\". The photographer then returned to the circuit and was able to resume his duties. Stewards deemed there to be no investigation necessary for the crash, judging it to be a racing incident which ensured no driver received a punishment for their involvement. Charles Leclerc eventually took first place in his home race, ahead of Oscar Piastri and Carlos Sainz . However, the race was slammed for being a procession, with even Max Verstappen , who came sixth, joking that he has \"wished he'd brought his pillow\". 🏁 Complete F1 2024 race calendar - details on every Grand Prix and start time this year 🏁",

        "content": "The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is set to oversee the KTDA elections for the director in a deal between the agency and the Tea Board of Kenya (TBK). The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will see the electoral agency oversee the voting process in all the seven regions across the country. It will provide all the requisite voting materials for use during the poll slated for next month. Tea farmers from all the 54 Kenya Tea Development Agency-managed factories across the country are set to elect new directors in the election. Voting will be through the secret ballot based on the one farmer one vote principle. IEBC is mandated by the Constitution under Article 88 (4) to conduct or supervise referenda and elections to any elective body or office established by the Constitution, and any other elections as prescribed by an Act of Parliament. According to the agreement, IEBC is set to appoint returning officers for each of the factories. It is also expected to publish a list of qualified candidates including the voter register in all the tea-buying centres ahead of the exercise. In conducting the poll, the electoral agency will be guided by a manual of elections released by TBK. The notice and timetable for the election, TBK said, will be published and circulated in all the tea-buying centres by next week. “The IEBC shall publish the polling stations within the electoral area in the respective tea factory at least seven days before the date of the elections,” reads a notice from the board. Each of the factories are conducting the elections based on their memorandums and articles of association in a bid to enhance fairness, the board said. Among the requirements that applicants are required to submit include Sh10,000 nonrefundable fee, ID card, growers’ slip for 12 months period preceding the date of the election, valid KRA tax compliant certificate and police and EACC clearance certificate. The applicants shortlisted will be vetted by the electoral agency before being cleared. The names of those successful will be posted on the tea-buying centres before the election date.",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Ethiopia’s aviation sector undergoes a revolutionary transformation as private charter carriers are granted access to the scheduled domestic passenger and cargo market. In a strategic effort to liberalize the domestic airline industry, the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority has granted private charter carriers access to Ethiopia’s scheduled domestic passenger and cargo market. In an announcement shared via social media, the authority disclosed that licenses have been issued to Ethiopian air transport operators, enabling them to offer regular passenger and cargo flights in addition to their existing charter services. Currently, Ethiopian Airlines (ET, Addis Ababa International) is the sole scheduled carrier in the country, while eight passenger charter operators are active, including Abyssinia Flight Services, Aquarius Aviation, East African Aviation, Midroc Aviation, National Airways (Ethiopia), Trans Nation Airways, Walya Airways, and Zemen Flying Service, as listed in the ch-aviation PRO airlines module. The Ethiopian regulator emphasized that over the past two years, it has been undergoing significant transformation, updating procedures and implementing new ones to promote private sector participation in domestic route operations. This initiative aims to enhance the aviation sector’s economic contribution, provide more incentives and opportunities for investors to offer safe services, connect different regions within the country, and boost tourism. Additionally, the authority announced the commencement of a project with private investors to construct over 21 airstrips and helipads across various parts of the country, particularly in areas currently lacking air transport access. Passenger traffic originating from Ethiopia surged 19% above pre-crisis levels in Q1 2023, significantly outpacing Africa’s overall passenger demand, which was up by 8.7% in the same period.",

        "description": "There was plenty of cup final success for former Swindon Town players over the weekend as the domestic season reached its climax",
        "content": "After the disappointment of seeing their unprecedented invincible season across all competitions fall against Atalanta in the Europa League final last week, Matej Kovar and Bayer Leverkusen made sure their season ended on a high in the DFB Pokal final. Kovar spent half a season with Swindon during their single-season stay in League One in 2020/21, getting his first taste of senior football on loan from Manchester United. Despite having been their designated cup goalkeeper this season and having started in Dublin in midweek, Kovar was on the bench as Leverkusen faced Kaiserslautern at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on Saturday. His Leverkusen team completed their domestic double with a 1-0 win despite being down to ten men for more than half of the final against their 2. Bundesliga opponents, completing their unbeaten run across all domestic matches for an entire season as they ended their 31-year wait for a major honour with a league and cup double. There was also final-day joy for Jack Stephens as he captained Southampton to promotion back to the Premier League in the championship playoff final at Wembley. The defender, who had two spells on loan at Swindon in 2013/14 and 2014/15, which included a League One playoff final defeat to Preston North End, was part of Russell Martin’s victorious Saints in the richest match in football. A fine defensive performance from the 30-year-old saw Southampton limit Leeds United to just two shots on target, and with Adam Armstrong on target at the other end, Southampton bounced back to the top flight at the first time of asking. There were no cup final celebrations for Jake O’Brien in the Coupe de France on Saturday, although he was on target against Paris Saint Germain as his Lyon side lost 2-1. The defender spent half a season with Swindon on loan from Crystal Palace during the 2021/22 season as Town made the League Two playoffs. First-half goals from Ousmane Dembele and Fabian Ruiz had Lyon up against it at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy as Kylian Mbappe ended his career in the French capital with a domestic double, but O’Brien headed home at the near post from a corner after the break to make a game of it. Lyon had secured Europa League football the previous weekend with a dramatic victory over Strasbourg.",

        "content": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin scolded NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday for suggesting alliance members should let Ukraine strike deep into Russia with Western weapons, and said it was clear that NATO was in a direct confrontation with Russia. Stoltenberg told The Economist that NATO members supplying weapons to Ukraine should end their prohibition on using them to strike military targets in Russia. \"NATO is increasing the degree of escalation,\" Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian daily Izvestia when asked about Stoltenberg's remarks. \"NATO is flirting with military rhetoric and falling into military ecstasy,\" Peskov said, adding that the Russian military knew what to do. When asked if NATO was approaching a direct confrontation with Russia, Peskov said: \"They are not getting close; they are in it.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned the West that it is risking a global war over Ukraine and that a direct conflict between Russia and NATO would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three. Russian officials say Ukrainian attacks deep inside Russia, including on civilian areas and even parts of Russia's nuclear defences, are directly escalatory. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Russia is now advancing along the front line in Ukraine. The United States has repeatedly said that it does not encourage Ukraine to strike inside Russia, though Ukraine has been lobbying hard to do so. The Economist said that Stoltenberg's remarks were clearly aimed at U.S. President Joe Biden, who has resisted allowing Ukraine to strike with U.S. weapons inside Russia.

This time, it involved a black Kia Rio and a red Nissan Tiida. In this accident, two people were injured, one more seriously than the other, for which two ambulances were rushed to the scene. The police closed off both sides of the road to freely handle the accident. Not only were the district police of Oranjestad present at the scene, but also the traffic police, who are responsible for documenting the accident. The damage was extensive, with the Tiida damaged at the rear and the Rio at the front. All this indicates that the Rio came at full speed and hit the rear of the Tiida, causing the collision. The victims were transported to the hospital to receive advanced medical attention. The police forensic team also arrived at the scene to take photos to aid in documenting the incident.",

On May 10, 2018, the ( FRRB ) sent a letter regarding respondent – CA, a partner at BPSD and Associates. The FRRB found various non-compliances in the financial statements of SICOM Investments and Finance Limited for the 2012-13 fiscal year, audited by the Respondent. Issues were identified with AS-3, AS-15, AS-16, AS-18, AS-20, AS-26, SA-700, parts of the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 2003, and specific notes and clauses in the Revised Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956. The committee found the following instances of professional misconduct as Guilty: The Committee noted that on the date of the hearing held on 19th March 2024, the Respondent was present through video conferencing and made his verbal representation on the Findings of the . He admitted that mistakes had happened. However, he requested the Committee not to consider them as misconduct as his intention was never to hide any information. The Committee also noted that the Respondent in his written representation, inter-alia, stated as under: The Committee considered the reasoning as contained in the Findings holding the Respondent Guilty of Professional Misconduct vis-à-vis written and verbal representation of the Respondent. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, along with the verbal and written representations, the Committee found non-compliances in the 2012-13 financial statements of SICOM Investments and Finance Limited, audited by the Respondent. These non-compliances relate to AS-15, AS-16, AS-18, SA-700, sections of the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 2003, and various notes and clauses in the Revised Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956.

Therefore, the Committee deemed it appropriate to administer punishment commensurate with the professional misconduct. Consequently, it was ordered to suspend CA from the Register of Members for a period of three months.

        "content": "The main attraction of will be the AI features that is building into the operating system. However, iOS 18 will not be just about generative AI tricks and ChatGPT or Gemini integration. A new report detailing Apple’s new features for iOS 18 details one simple but meaningful change that people have spent years begging for. If Mark Gurman’s information is accurate, iPhone and iPad users will finally be able to place apps anywhere on the screen rather than having to conform to the grid of apps that Apple has used since the original . And yes, widgets will likely get the same freedom. Gurman wrote in his latest report that iOS 18 will revamp the Home Screen. It’ll be a “fun improvement” that’s not related to AI. Apple will let you change the color of app icons and put them wherever you like, the insider wrote: Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the For instance, you can make all your social icons blue or finance-related ones green — and they won’t need to be placed in the standard grid that has existed since day one in 2007. Gurman made similar claims about two months ago. At the time, he said without offering any details. But a separate report noted that Apple planned let iPhone users place apps anywhere on the screen rather than forcing the grid layout we all know so well. I’ve always been a fan of the Android Home Screen, where you can place apps anywhere you like. There’s a grid at play there, too, yes. But apps will not autoarrange themselves on it when you install a new app. I don’t like the iPhone app arrangement system because it feels too crowded. I say that as someone who doesn’t have any apps on my desktop. I’d want a similar look on the iPhone. Between the introduction of folders, widgets, and the App Gallery Home Screen, I’ve managed to give myself the impression that the Home Screens I use on iPhone aren’t as crowded. I also hide screens of apps that I need only in certain instances to help me navigate the iPhone faster. That helps me reduce the number of folders and extra Home Screens I use at any given time. I can’t wait for this rumored iOS 18 feature to roll out. I won’t mess with the app icon colors, though I’m sure many iPhone users will love that level of UI customization. But I’ll certainly rearrange my iPhone apps to free up more space on the screen as soon as I install the first iOS 18 beta.",
