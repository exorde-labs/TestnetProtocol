# Key Protocol Highlights

Exorde is a decentralized data system, which operates an information processing pipeline at its core. This pipeline continuously receives the flix of the most recent data posted on the Internet (tweets, articles, blog posts, etc.) and processes it (translation, aggregation, curation, clustering) to produce reliable, relevant, and quality metadata, to provide accurate and real-time trend, source and sentiment analysis.

Exorde has **Spotters**, participants specialized in **spotting the newest and most relevant information online** (by providing URLs, detected langage and other content identifiers). The data is then fed into the Exorde Worksystems, composing the Exorde Data Pipeline. These are forming a **streaming data pipeline** processing & **validating** the spotted information, in a by allocating sub-tasks to **Validators** in each WorkSystems. 

The Exorde Protocol uses its **Exorde Network Token (EXD) as incentives**, to align all ecosystem participants interests and maximize the reactivity, scalability, and quality of Exorde's output data & internal processes. A as a decentralized protocol, Exorde **allows anyone to verify** its data stream and internal WorkSystems.


# Key Token Utility

## Exorde Network Token (EXD) is at the core of the Exorde Network data economy.

EXD is a pure utility token steering Exorde's economy through 3 main utilities:

![Access Icons & Symbols](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/2989/2989874.png =50x50)1. **EXD is a Protocol access token**. 

**Data Spotters and Validators are required to Stake EXD tokens** to participate in the Exorde Data Economy. There are 2 different aspects to EXD Staking:
	- A **Minimum EXD Stake** is required to participate in the various tasks of the Protocol. This minimum level can be different depending on a given Protocol System and its importance.
	- A **dynamic stake mechanism**: Data Spotter will need as much Staked EXD tokens as they are submitting data to Exorde. This mechanism de-incentivize data-spamming attacks and encourages the spotting of quality information. Stake is automatically unlocked after some time when a given work has been validated by the Exorde Network.

**The Exorde Protocol processing power is constantly being auctioned** to the highest bidder, and the highest bounties are given priority by the Exorde Network. **Protocol clients can place bounties to orient Exorde Workforce** to crawl, collect, and process data according to their requirements: *Topic(s), duration of the analysis, crawling frequency, language, theme, set of websites or links, etc.*

**Data Spotters and Validators earn rewards for their data-related work.** 
There are different tasks in the Exorde Protocol, divided in 2 main categories: 
	- **Spotting** relevant and recenty-posted latest information (URLs) to provide Exorde with the very best data
	- **Processing & validating data** to secure Exorde's data processes
Nodes (participants) of the network earn EXD token as rewards, but also Reputation (REP) used as requirements to participate in Exorde's Technical Governance. 

**The above token model ensures that EXD steers Exorde Protocol's economy and captures both its supply and demand sides.**



# EXD Token allocation

The Exorde Network Token has a fixed total supply of 200,000,000 EXD. The Exorde Network Token is deployed on Ethereum as capped-supply ERC20. There will never be more than two hundred millions EXD tokens.

The initial token allocation is designed to be balanced between ecosystem participants (Protocol rewards), investors & backers, and the Exorde Labs team.

![Allocations](https://i.postimg.cc/J43xf6WF/Pie-Chart-Token.png)


### 34% of total EXD Allocated to Protocol Rewards
1. **A third of the token supply is allocated to be distributed as rewards for Exorde Protocol participants.**
2. **Rewards are distributed at a maximum rate of 30 000 EXD per day** (*1 250 EXD per hour*). 
3. This **guarantees** a **maximum token inflation rate from the Protocol Rewards**.
4. **EXD Rewards will be distributed until at least Q2 2029**. 

*The demand for the protocol and its data services is expected to create a **sustainable** reward stream over time, complementing then taking over the protocol's initial rewards pool.* 

Depending on the demand for Exorde's Token & Data (and other factors), the rewards rate is likely to be much lower than the maximum rate, offering a guaranteed source of rewards during at least 10 years.

*Exorde Labs will progressively enable Exorde's Governance to govern this rate (within the limitation of 30 000).*

### Private Sale Participants

Private investors are composed of 30+ invidivudals and private investment funds focalised on Web3, blockchain and advanced data products. They have bought EXD token on presale at an average price of $0.15-0.20. 
**Private sale investors have a 1-month cliff period and linear vesting of 24-months (2 years), without exception.**

# Token Distribution
![Token Distribution over time](https://i.postimg.cc/gYxRRSTP/Token-Supply-Projection.jpg)
Initially only 12-15 millions tokens will be in circulation. In May 2023, we expect 10% of the supply to be in circulation (20 000 000 EXD).

**Linear vestings schedules**: 
- The Exorde Team has **5 years** of vesting. 
- Exorde Labs itself has **6 years** of vesting.
- Protocol Rewards can't be released faster than 6.2 years, most likely 10+ years
- Private investors have 2 years vesting.
- Airdrops and community bounties are to be distributed punctually over time.
- All other allocation have no vesting period.
 
**Once deployed, Vesting contract are non-revokable and immutable.**
Exorde's initial distribution of 200,000,000 tokens and their lockups (vesting) reflect long term commitments from the Exorde Labs team and their backers, investors & partners. 

*Protocol Rewards case: Exorde Labs will manage the transfer of Protocol Rewards to the Protocol (on its execution layer) during the early life of the protocol. Then, the Vesting Contract ownership can be transfered to the Exorde Decentralized Governance.*

# Key Technical Facts


### ERC20 Token
**Official Token Address: https://etherscan.io/token/0x02de007d412266a2e0fa9287c103474170f06560**

The EXD token exist on **Ethereum Mainnet** as an ERC20 with a capped supply of 200 000 000 (*two hundred millions*).
 **0x02dE007D412266a2e0Fa9287C103474170F06560 is the official contract address of the EXD Token.** 

*To be utilized, the token is expected to be bridged on Exorde Execution layer (powered by the SKALE Network). Mainnet contracts and intermediary interfaces can be deployed later.*

### Audit
Exorde Token, Vesting Wallets (for Team, Protocol Rewards, Private Sale investors, etc) and Token Sale contracts are audited by CertiK. The audits can be found at: https://www.certik.com/projects/exorde



### TECHNICAL GOVERNANCE

 **Exorde aims to be governed by Reputation (REP)**. 
**REP** is a **non-transferable** score that is only earned by correctly participating in the Exorde Protocol. Reputation is a better indicator of currently active and involved actors of the Exorde ecosystem than Exorde Token Holders, and allows to operate Technical Governance in a scalable manner. **REP is a relative unit of account, allowing to accurately measure the contribution of each actors of the ecosystem**

**As opposed to most DAOs of the past years, Token Holders will not be required to participate in highly technical proposals or frequent decision-making. Exorde is designed for a scalable and informed decision-making system!**

Reputational actors of the Exorde Ecosystem vote on proposals to change the various System & Data-related Parameters (data sources, data formats, highly technical details, processing rules, rewards rate, required staking thresholds, etc).
An EXD Token-based governance will be activated only during rare events (network migration, recovery, fundamental changes, etc.). 
**All Reputational actor, involved in Exorde's future technical governance, will also have a Token Stake.**



# Token Sale: Opens on February 15th 2023



**The Exorde Token Sale is expected to take place Feb 15th at 9am UTC.**

The Token Sale is, by necessity, compliant with AML/KYC regulations. 
The sale will be conducted on a dedicated Public Sale page on exorde.network.
The sale will accept only USDC, USDT and DAI, all ERC20 tokens on Ethereum.
The Exorde Token Sale contract will be deployed on Ethereum.

**The Exorde Network Token (EXD) is  a 18-decimal, standard, supply-capped ERC20 token on Ethereum.**
The EXD token is to be deployed soon.
It will last at most 1 month, by default, but this can be extended by Exorde Labs, if necessary.

**User will be able to pass the KYC prior to the start date, to be ready for the start date.**

**The EXD Public Token Sale is a 3-Tiered Dollar-based Token Sale. The Tiers are automatically activated when a previous Tier is complete. FIRST COME FIRST SERVED.**
*      Tier 1 = $0.33/EXD for the first 0.5 million (500 000) EXD tokens sold
*      Tier 2 = $0.34/EXD for next 1.5 million (1 500 000) EXD tokens sold
*      Tier 3 = $0.35/EXD for the last 10 million (10 000 000) EXD tokens sold.
 **Total EXD sold (to be deposited in contract initially) = 12 000 000 EXD tokens. Twelve millions.**

* All buyers must be whitelisted by Exorde Labs, according to their KYC verification done on exorde.network
* All buyers are limited to $50k ($50 000),  fifty thousand dollars of purchase, overall (they can buy multiple times).
* A tier ends when all tokens have been sold. 
* If tokens remain unsold after the sale, Exorde Labs can withdraw the remaining tokens & allocate it for future Sale (or to the protocol, etc).
* Buyers get the EXD token instantly when buying. 
* The contract handle buying overlaps between tiers automatically, and also refunds if a user sends more than what remains in the sale.
* The owner can pause the contract in case of emergency
