## Exorde Network Token (EXD) is at the core of the Exorde Network data economy.

EXD is a pure utility token steering Exorde's economy through 3 main utilities:

**Data Spotters and Validators are required to Stake EXD tokens** to participate in the Exorde Data Economy. There are 2 different aspects to EXD Staking:
	- A **Minimum EXD Stake** is required to participate in the various tasks of the Protocol. This minimum level can be different depending on a given Protocol System and its importance.
	- A **dynamic stake mechanism**: Data Spotter will need as many Staked EXD tokens as they are submitting data to Exorde. This mechanism de-incentivize data-spamming attacks and encourages the spotting of quality information. The stake is automatically unlocked after some time when a given work has been validated by the Exorde Network.

**The Exorde Protocol processing power is constantly being auctioned** to the highest bidder, and the highest bounties are given priority by the Exorde Network. **Protocol clients can place bounties to orient Exorde Workforce** to crawl, collect, and process data according to their requirements: *Topic(s), duration of the analysis, crawling frequency, language, theme, set of websites or links, etc.*

**Data Spotters and Validators earn rewards for their data-related work.** 
There are different tasks in the Exorde Protocol, divided into 2 main categories: 
	- **Spotting** relevant and recently-posted latest information (URLs) to provide Exorde with the very best data
	- **Processing & validating data** to secure Exorde's data processes
Nodes (participants) of the network earn EXD tokens as rewards, but also Reputation (REP) used as a requirement to participate in Exorde's Technical Governance. 

**The above token model ensures that EXD steers Exorde Protocol's economy and captures both its supply and demand sides.**



# EXD Token allocation

The Exorde Network Token has a fixed total supply of 200,000,000 EXD. The Exorde Network Token is deployed on Ethereum as capped-supply ERC20. There will never be more than two hundred million EXD tokens.

The initial token allocation is designed to be balanced between ecosystem participants (Protocol rewards), investors & backers, and the Exorde Labs team.

## 34% of total EXD Allocated to Protocol Rewards

### What are Protocol Rewards?

**Protocol rewards are digital incentives offered by the network for participating and contributing to the network.** These rewards are granted to users who submit, process or validate data or make other valuable contributions to the Exorde network. Think of it as an automated system that rewards users for their work in maintaining and improving the network. **These rewards are meant to encourage users to participate in the network, which helps to ensure its security, stability, and growth.**

### Protocol Rewards distribution

1. **A third of the token supply is allocated to be distributed as rewards for Exorde Protocol participants.**
2. **Rewards are distributed at a maximum rate of 30 000 EXD per day** (*1 250 EXD per hour*). 
3. This **guarantees** a **maximum token inflation rate from the Protocol Rewards**.
4. **EXD Rewards will be distributed until at least Q2 2029**. 

*The demand for the protocol and its data services is expected to create a **sustainable** reward stream over time, complementing and then taking over the protocol's initial rewards pool.* 

Depending on the demand for Exorde's Token & Data (and other factors), the rewards rate is likely to be much lower than the maximum rate, offering a guaranteed source of rewards for at least 10 years.

*Exorde Labs will progressively enable Exorde's Governance to govern this rate (within the limits of 30 000).*

## Private Sale Participants

Private investors are composed of 30+ individuals and private investment funds focalized on Web3, blockchain, and advanced data products. They have bought EXD tokens on presale at an average price of $0.12-0.22. 
**Private sale investors have a 1-month cliff period and linear vesting of 24 months (2 years), without exception.**

# Token Distribution
![Token Distribution over time](https://i.postimg.cc/gYxRRSTP/Token-Supply-Projection.jpg)
Initially, only 12-15 million tokens will be in circulation. In May 2023, we expect 10% of the supply to be in circulation (20 000 000 EXD).

**Linear vestings schedules**: 
- The Exorde Team has **5 years** of vesting. 
- Exorde Labs itself has **6 years** of vesting.
- Protocol Rewards can't be released faster than 6.2 years, most likely 10+ years
- Private investors have 2 years of vesting.
- Airdrops and community bounties are to be distributed punctually over time.
- All other allocations have no vesting period.
 
**Once deployed, Vesting contracts are non-revokable and immutable.**
Exorde's initial distribution of 200,000,000 tokens and their lockups (vesting) reflect long-term commitments from the Exorde Labs team and their backers, investors & partners. 

*Protocol Rewards case: Exorde Labs will manage the transfer of Protocol Rewards to the Protocol (on its execution layer) during the early life of the protocol. Then, the Vesting Contract ownership can be transferred to the Exorde Decentralized Governance.*

# Key Technical Facts


### ERC20 Token
**Official Token Address: https://etherscan.io/token/0x02de007d412266a2e0fa9287c103474170f06560**

The EXD token exists on **Ethereum Mainnet** as an ERC20 with a capped supply of 200 000 000 (*two hundred million *).
 **0x02dE007D412266a2e0Fa9287C103474170F06560 is the official contract address of the EXD Token.** 

*To be utilized, the token is expected to be bridged on the Exorde Execution layer (powered by the SKALE Network). Mainnet contracts and intermediary interfaces can be deployed later.*

### Audit
Exorde Token, Vesting Wallets (for Team, Protocol Rewards, Private Sale investors, etc), and Token Sale contracts are audited by CertiK. The audits can be found at: https://www.certik.com/projects/exorde

### Vesting: what is it?

A vesting schedule is a plan for the release of tokens over time. It is a way to ensure that tokens are distributed gradually, rather than all at once. This helps to prevent the rapid dumping of tokens, which can lead to price volatility and negatively impact the stability of the network. In the context of Exorde, the vesting schedule applies to different groups of actors. The vesting schedule outlines the timeline for when these actors will be able to access their tokens and the conditions under which they will be released. This helps to align incentives and ensure the long-term health of the network.

### Vesting smart contract: why is it important?

Having a vesting schedule enforced by audited, public, immutable smart contracts adds transparency and accountability to a project and company. It ensures that the allocation of tokens is properly aligned with the long-term interests of the project and its stakeholders and that the tokens are not released too quickly, which could negatively impact the stability and value of the token. Additionally, having a vesting schedule implemented through smart contracts, eliminates the possibility of manual errors or manipulation, making the process more secure, irrevocable, and reliable.


### TECHNICAL GOVERNANCE

 **Exorde aims to be governed by Reputation (REP)**. 
**REP** is a **non-transferable** score that is only earned by correctly participating in the Exorde Protocol. Reputation is a better indicator of currently active and involved actors of the Exorde ecosystem than Exorde Token Holders and allows to operate Technical Governance in a scalable manner. **REP is a relative unit of account, allowing for an accurate measure of the contribution of each actor of the ecosystem**

**As opposed to most DAOs of the past years, Token Holders will not be required to participate in highly technical proposals or frequent decision-making. Exorde is designed for a scalable and informed decision-making system!**

Reputational actors of the Exorde Ecosystem vote on proposals to change the various System & Data-related Parameters (data sources, data formats, highly technical details, processing rules, rewards rate, required staking thresholds, etc).
An EXD Token-based governance will be activated only during rare events (network migration, recovery, fundamental changes, etc.). 
**All Reputational actors, involved in Exorde's future technical governance, will also have a Token Stake.**



# Token Sale: Opens on February 15th, 2023

**The Exorde Token Sale is expected to take place Feb 15th at 9 am UTC.**

The Token Sale is, by necessity, compliant with AML/KYC regulations. 
The sale will be conducted on a dedicated Public Sale page on the exorde.network.
The sale will accept only USDC, USDT, and DAI (ERC20 tokens on Ethereum).
The Exorde Token Sale contract will be deployed on Ethereum.

**The Exorde Network Token (EXD) is  a 18-decimal, standard, supply-capped ERC20 token on Ethereum.**
The Sale will last at most 1 month, by default, but this can be extended by Exorde Labs, if necessary.

**User will be able to pass the KYC before the start date, to be ready for the start date.**

**The EXD Public Token Sale is a 3-Tiered Dollar-based Token Sale. The Tiers are automatically activated when a previous Tier is complete. FIRST COME FIRST SERVED.**
*      Tier 1 = $0.33/EXD for the first 0.5 million (500 000) EXD tokens sold
*      Tier 2 = $0.34/EXD for the next 1.5 million (1 500 000) EXD tokens sold
*      Tier 3 = $0.35/EXD for the last 10 million (10 000 000) EXD tokens sold.
 **Total EXD sold (to be deposited in contract initially) = 12 000 000 EXD tokens. Twelve million.**

* All buyers must be whitelisted (through a KYC provider, *sumsub.com*) by Exorde Labs, according to their KYC verification done on exorde.network
* All buyers are limited to $50k ($50 000),  fifty thousand dollars of purchase, overall (they can buy multiple times).
* A tier ends when all tokens have been sold. 
* If tokens remain unsold after the sale, Exorde Labs can withdraw the remaining tokens & allocate them for future private sales (or to the protocol, bounties, etc.).
* Buyers get EXD tokens instantly when buying. 
* The contract handle buying overlaps between tiers automatically and also refunds if a user sends more than what remains in the sale.
